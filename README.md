# AngularCrudApp

Sample Angular CRUD application.

# Notes
Make sure the windows desktop is all set to do key auth.
Else it will hang in different places on npm or bower install.
Make sure pageant.exe is running and exposing the keys you want to use if Git is set to use plink.exe
as its SSH agent.
